Project Name: Pet Sell Platform.

Description: 
Pet Sell Platform makes it easy to sort pets and services by price, age, breed, location, or ratings, helping you quickly find the perfect match. Enjoy a seamless experience connecting with trusted sellers and services tailored to your needs.

5 key fetures of my project:
    1. Advanced Options: Filter pets and services by price to find the perfect match 
       easily.

    2. User-Friendly Interface: A simple, intuitive design ensures seamless navigation
       and browsing for buyers and sellers alike.

    3. Comprehensive Pet Listings: Detailed profiles for pets, including health,
       breed, and age, provide all the information needed to make informed decisions.

    4. Real-Time Availability: Updated listings ensure you only see pets and services
       that are currently available, avoiding outdated or unavailable options.

    5. Location-Based Search: Find pets and services near you with location-specific 
       sorting, making it easier to connect locally.
